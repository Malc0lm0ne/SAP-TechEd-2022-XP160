**Now you can test and preview the UI application in SAP Business Application Studio**

1. Right click on your project folder "helloworldui5" and choose Preview Application. 



 

2. Choose npm script: start-noflp fiori run --open "intex.html?sap-ui-xx-viewCache=false"





A new browser tab opens with your app:



Now let us change the title of the app to "HelloWorld".

3. Go to Explorer in the left navigation pane.

4. Open folder "webapp" and subfolder view (in our example View1). Click on the page title inside the blue box. The element ID "page" will be selected.

5. Change "{i18n>title}" to "HelloWorld".



You will see the changes in the application preview accordingly: "HelloWorld" instead of "Hello World App Title".
