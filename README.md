# XP160 - Get Started with SAP BTP Leveraging SAP Discovery Center

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session XP160 - Get Started with SAP BTP Leveraging SAP Discovery Center.

## Overview

Learn how the SAP Discovery Center supports you in effectively working with SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and leveraging from its services. You will take your first steps on SAP BTP guided by a use-case mission generating concrete business value and providing all relevant technical information. The goal of the exercises is to create a simple Hello World application using SAPUI5 / SAP Fiori running on SAP BTP leveraging SAP Business Application Studio, Cloud Foundry runtime, and SAP Launchpad Service - all based on a SAP Discovery Center mission that will guide you through the tasks.

## Requirements

SAP BTP trial account with entitlements to SAP Business Application Studio and SAP Launchpad service.
 
NOTE: SAP Launchpad Service is part of the SAP Build portfolio. In early 2023, we launch a new experience with the new name SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition. You can learn more in the Roadmap Explorer. Please be aware that some screenshots or systems in this Hands-on material might still contain the former name SAP Launchpad Service.
